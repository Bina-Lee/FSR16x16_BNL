# FSR16x16_BNL
A library for arduino/MCU to read value of 16x16 FSR array sensor

This Arduino library is designed to scan a 16x16 FSR (Force Sensitive Resistor) pressure sensor matrix using **only 3 GPIO pins**.  
It implements a hardware-efficient approach using **an 8-bit binary counter and an analog multiplexer**, controlled by minimal digital clock and clear signals.

This minimizes the typical 32-pin (16 rows + 16 columns) setup to:
- **1 analog input pin** (multiplexer output)
- **2 digital pins** (clock + clear signals)

## üîå Circuit Setup

### Minimal 3-Pin Mode
This mode uses an 8-bit binary counter to reduce GPIO usage to just 3 pins:
- **Counter**: 8-bit binary counter IC (e.g., 74HC590)  
- **Decoder/Multiplexer**: connected to counter outputs  
- **MCU Pins**:
    - `clearPin` (digital): counter reset
    - `clockPin` (digital): counter clock pulse
    - `analogPin` (analog): reads multiplexer output

> üìñ Refer to the accompanying design paper for detailed wiring diagrams.  
> üì∑ A sample circuit diagram for this mode is shown below.

---

### Direct Mode (32 GPIO Pins)
For applications where GPIO availability is not a concern, you can directly connect the MCU to the 16 rows and 16 columns of the FSR matrix:
- **MCU Pins**:
    - 16 digital pins for rows
    - 16 digital pins for columns
- This mode provides the fastest scanning speed but requires 32 GPIO pins.

---

### MUX/DEMUX Mode (9 GPIO Pins)
This mode uses a multiplexer for column reading and a demultiplexer for row selection to reduce the required GPIO pins:
- **Row Selection**: 4-to-16 line decoder (e.g., 74HC154) as a demultiplexer  
- **Column Reading**: Analog multiplexer for column outputs  
- **MCU Pins**:
    - 4 digital pins for row selection
    - 4 digital pins for column selection
    - 1 analog pin to read the multiplexer output
- This mode balances GPIO usage and scanning speed.

---

### TIMER4 Mode (5 GPIO Pins)
This mode uses a 4-bit binary counter for row selection and a multiplexer for column reading:
- **Counter**: 4-bit binary counter IC (e.g., 74HC161)  
- **Multiplexer**: Analog multiplexer for column outputs  
- **MCU Pins**:
    - `clearPin` (digital): counter reset
    - `clockPin` (digital): counter clock pulse
    - 2 digital pins for column selection
    - 1 analog pin to read the multiplexer output
- This mode minimizes GPIO usage further by reducing the total required pins to just 5.

---

### Combined Modes and Configurations
By combining the above modes, you can create up to **10 different circuit configurations**, including:
- **Row Configurations (3 types)**:  
    1. **Direct GPIO**: Each row is controlled by a dedicated GPIO pin.  
    2. **Demultiplexer**: A 4-to-16 line decoder (e.g., 74HC154) is used for row selection, reducing GPIO usage.  
    3. **Demultiplexer + 4-bit Counter**: Combines a demultiplexer with a 4-bit binary counter for efficient row selection.  

- **Column Configurations (3 types)**:  
    1. **Direct GPIO**: Each column is connected to a dedicated GPIO pin.  
    2. **Multiplexer**: An analog multiplexer is used to read column outputs, reducing GPIO usage.  
    3. **Multiplexer + 4-bit Counter**: Combines a multiplexer with a 4-bit binary counter for column reading.  

- **TIMER8 Mode**:  
    A single 8-bit binary counter is used for both row and column selection, requiring only minimal GPIO pins while maintaining full functionality.  

> üì∑ A sample circuit diagram for one of these configurations is shown below.

### Key Notes
- **Row Type (`rowT`)**:
    - `DIRECT`: Requires an array of 16 pins for direct GPIO connection.
    - `DE_MUX`: Used when the row selection utilizes a demultiplexer. Requires an array of 4 pins for demultiplexer selection.
    - `TIMER4`: Requires `clearPin` and `clockPin` for counter control, with active edge types (`FALLING` or `RISING`).

- **Column Type (`colT`)**:
    - `DIRECT`: Requires an array of 16 pins for direct GPIO connection.
    - `DE_MUX`: Used when the column selection utilizes a multiplexer. Requires an array of 4 pins for multiplexer selection and an **output pin**.
    - `TIMER4`: Requires `clearPin`, `clockPin`, and an **output pin**, with active edge types (`FALLING` or `RISING`).

- **TIMER8 Mode**:
    - Combines row and column control into a single 8-bit counter, requiring `clearPin`, `clockPin`, and an **output pin**, with active edge types (`FALLING` or `RISING`).

> **Note**: The `DE_MUX` type is designed to represent configurations where either the rows use a demultiplexer or the columns use a multiplexer, or both.

    // Example 1: Access individual value
    int centerValue = sensor.get(8, 8);

## üí° Notes

- **Make sure to wire the hardware exactly as described** in the provided design document for the 3-pin setup.
- This library also supports more complex setups (DIRECT, DEMUX, TIMER4), but its main goal is to demonstrate the **minimum GPIO 3-pin configuration**.
- For visualizing the data, you can forward the serial output to Python or Processing to create real-time pressure maps.=
